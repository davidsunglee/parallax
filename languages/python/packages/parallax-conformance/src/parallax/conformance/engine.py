"""The conformance compile/run engine — binding the corpus to the spine.

The adapter path compiles and runs a compatibility case directly against the
class-free engine spine (no dynamic class synthesis): the case's model YAML is
ingested through the ``m-descriptor`` deserializer, its ``when.operation`` through
the ``m-op-algebra`` deserializer, and the tree is lowered by ``m-sql``
``compile_read`` to one canonical ``Statement``. ``compile`` emits that statement;
``run`` executes it through the injected ``m-db-port`` and records the observed
rows. Compile eligibility (``m-case-format`` ``compileEligibility``) is read from
the case; the run-only minority is never compiled.

# (coalesce -> FK-order -> elide, ``m-unit-work``) and each surviving
# :class:`PlannedWrite` is lowered to DML by the shared
# ``snapshot.handle.lower_write`` seam — the deliberate ``m-sql`` write edge the
# conformance family may compose (the import-side DAG exemption). A **scenario** is
# a *sequence* of units of work: a write step commits (or, ``rollback: true``,
# aborts) its coalesced DML, then a ``find`` reads committed state through the read
# path. A **writeSequence** lowers each entry independently — no cross-entry
# coalescing (an insert-then-delete pair across two entries is two round trips, not
# a cancellation) — and, post the DQ4 re-route below, each entry is its OWN
# transaction (COR-3 Phase 8 increment 4 changes this from "the whole sequence in
# one transaction").
#
# COR-3 Phase 8 increment 4 (DQ4 re-route, ledger D-18): the RUN lane now executes
# every write choreography unit — a writeSequence entry, a scenario write step, a
# conflict attempt — through the SHIPPED ``db.transact`` entry point (one
# transaction per unit, ``clock=FixedClock(<entry at>)``, ADR 0010), buffered
# through the neutral ``Transaction._buffer`` route + ``UnitOfWork.observe`` (never
# the typed instance verbs, which this engine's case-driven metamodel has no
# compiled classes for). The COMPILE lane still lowers PURELY (no database,
# ``plan_flush`` / ``lower_write``) — that pure lowering is ALSO what the RUN
# lane's emissions/round-trips observation grades against, since both are the
# SAME deterministic computation over the SAME instructions/observations/instant
# (`_resolve_entries` / `_lower_resolved` below are the shared core).

# The lowering failures the write lanes convert to a neutral :class:`EngineError`,
# so the adapter reports a ``*-failed`` diagnostic rather than leaking a lower-layer
# exception type across the conformance seam. `opt_lock.UnobservedVersionError` /
# `.HistoricalObservationError` / `.CallerAuthoredVersionError` are m-opt-lock's own
# forward-error posture (COR-3 Phase 8 increment 3; the core amendment bundle adds
# the last one once the M4-era literal-version passthrough retires);
# `temporal_state.AmbiguousObservationError` is this increment's own (a shape no
# reachable case exercises). A deferred witness (the materializing / auto-retry-
# boundary forms, increments 5/6) that reaches this engine-local write path without
# a recorded observation must degrade to a reasoned `EngineError`, never an
