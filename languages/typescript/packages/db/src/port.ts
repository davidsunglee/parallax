/**
 * `@parallax/db` — the abstract runtime **database port** (M11 decomposition,
 * core spec `m11-dialect-seam.md` → *M11 decomposition*, layer 2).
 *
 * This is the execution interface every layer above the seam calls to run
 * compiled SQL and demarcate transactions: `execute(sql, binds) → rows` and an
 * optional `transaction(body)`. It **depends on nothing application-specific** —
 * no driver, no concrete database, no dialect, no harness — beyond the neutral
 * `@parallax/core` types its contract names, so any layer may hold the port
 * without acquiring a database dependency.
 *
 * The port carries the **normalize-at-boundary contract**: a concrete adapter
 * behind it (`@parallax/db-postgres`, and future `@parallax/db-*`) returns rows
 * whose scalars are already **managed values** — `bigint` / `ParallaxDecimal` /
 * `Temporal.Instant` / `Temporal.PlainDate` / `Temporal.PlainTime` /
 * `Uint8Array` / string — produced by the dialect layer's parse functions, never
 * raw driver representations. Nothing above the seam ever sees a driver's `Date`,
 * a binary-float `numeric`, or a raw byte buffer. Wire rendering + grading is a
 * grader concern that lives above the port, never in the port or an adapter
 * (*managed at the boundary, wire at the grader*).
 *
 * Extracted cleanly out of the `@parallax/typescript` runtime at this point (no
 * back-compat re-export — there were no external consumers of the inline
 * definition). The method is named `execute` for parity with the core M11
 * contract; `ParallaxClock` stays in `@parallax/typescript` because it is a
 * runtime strategy, not a database concern.
